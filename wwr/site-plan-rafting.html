    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Building a website for my whitewater rafting business will help me achieve several goals and benefits. First, it will allow me to showcase the amazing adventures that I offer on the river, with photos, videos, and stories from my customers. Second, it will provide useful information to potential customers, such as the types of trips, the prices, the availability, the safety guidelines, and the contact details. Third, it will enable me to reach a wider audience and market my business online, using social media, SEO, and email marketing. Fourth, it will increase my conversion rate and generate more bookings, by making it easy and convenient for customers to reserve their spots online. My website will be a powerful tool to grow my business and share my passion for rafting with more people.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target customers are people who are looking for an exciting and memorable outdoor activity. They are mostly young adults (18-35 years old) who have a moderate to high income and enjoy adventure sports. They want to have fun, challenge themselves, and experience nature in a different way. They need a reliable and professional rafting company that can offer them a variety of trips, from easy to difficult, and ensure their safety and satisfaction. My audience will usually access my site from their mobile devices, as they are likely to search for rafting options while traveling or planning their trips.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
